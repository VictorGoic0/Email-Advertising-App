## Notes

### Netlify Deployment (Simple & Fast)
- Netlify auto-detects Vite/React apps
- `netlify.toml` provides explicit configuration
- GitHub integration enables automatic deployments
- Free tier includes: 100GB bandwidth, 300 build minutes/month
- Deploy previews for PRs are helpful for testing

### Railway Deployment (Simple & Powerful)
- Railway auto-detects Python apps via `requirements.txt`
- No Docker required (Railway handles containerization)
- PostgreSQL plugin auto-configures database
- Free tier includes: $5/month credit, shared CPU, 512MB RAM
- CLI available for manual operations: `railway run alembic upgrade head`
- Environment variables set via dashboard (secure)

### Key Considerations
1. **Database Migration**: SQLite → PostgreSQL requires schema recreation (Alembic migrations)
2. **Environment Variables**: Must be set on both platforms before first deployment
3. **CORS**: Backend must explicitly allow Netlify frontend URL
4. **Node.js**: Railway includes Node.js for MJML package
5. **Secrets**: Never commit `.env` files; use platform dashboards
6. **Testing**: Test locally with production build before deploying

### Deployment Order
1. Deploy backend to Railway first (get API URL)
2. Set `VITE_API_URL` in Netlify to Railway URL
3. Deploy frontend to Netlify
4. Test end-to-end integration
5. Update documentation with URLs

### Estimated Time
- **PR #18** (Netlify): 1-2 hours (mostly configuration and testing)
- **PR #19** (Railway): 2-3 hours (database migration, testing, monitoring)
- **Total**: 3-5 hours for both PRs

### Success Criteria
- ✅ Frontend loads on Netlify URL
- ✅ Backend API responds on Railway URL
- ✅ Login flow works end-to-end
- ✅ Asset upload works (S3 integration)
- ✅ Campaign creation works
- ✅ Email generation works (OpenAI + MJML)
- ✅ Approval workflow works
- ✅ Monitoring dashboard works
- ✅ No console errors
- ✅ HTTPS enabled on both platforms
